= Diagnosing and preventing Network Problems with Health Check
:navtitle: Health Check
:page-topic-type: howto

[abstract]
In today's distributed and virtual environments, users will often not have full administrative control over their whole network.
Health Check introduces _Ping_ to check nodes are still healthy, and to force idle connections to be kept alive in environments with eager shutdowns of unused resources.
_Diagnostics_ requests a report from a node, giving instant health check information.


Diagnosing problems in distributed environments is far from easy, so Couchbase provides a _Health Check API_ with `ping()` for active monitoring. and `diagnostics()` for a look at what the client believes is the current state of the cluster.
More extensive discussion of the uses of Health Check can be found in the xref:concept-docs:health-check.adoc[Health Check Concept Guide].


== Ping

At its simplest, `ping` provides information about the current state of the connections in the Couchbase Cluster, by actively polling:

[source,python]
----
    ping_result = bucket.ping()

----

Which returns a `PingResult` object, encapsulating a payload similar to this:
// TODO -- multiple nodes

            }
        ]
    },
    "version": 1
}
----

If you only wish to know if there's a connection that's up, filter out the rest of the information:

[source,python]
----
def ok(bucket):
    result = bucket.ping()
    for endpoint, reports in result.endpoints.items():
        for report in reports:
            if not report.state == PingState.OK:
                return False
    return True

----

You can also specify a subset of services to ping, if you are only interested in a particular set of services and don't wish to
actively ping the others:

[source,python]
----
ping_result = bucket.ping(PingOptions(service_types=[ServiceType.Query])

----


== Diagnostics


`Diagnostics` returns a list of the nodes that the SDK currently has (or had) a connection to, and the current status of the connection.
However this call _does not_ actively poll the nodes, reporting instead the state the last time it tried to access each node.
If you want the _current_ status, then use xref:#ping[Ping].

[source,python]
----
diag_result = cluster.diagnostics()
print(diag_result.as_json())

----

Which will print the diagnostics result as a json string.  For instance, on a single node cluster that has had n1ql queries and kv operations
executed, you will see something like:

    "_id": "0x7f8e8d464350",
